#+TITLE: Tracker

* Desired Changes
- Config files
  - Do we need some way to extend configs? add paths to package json
    - take keys and map to some env variable?
    - kinda brittle to map to env variables
- look into keeping content hash when app or library
  - since its a package only the main app needs to be discernable
- setup flow packages
- setup flow typed
- setup eslint
- setup cypress
  - react-scripts browser test script
  - setup cypress.json
  - create cypress folder
  - add cypress command
  - add cypress dep
** For Apps
- Setup for importing into a main app
  - exporting as a package
- When importing into main app make sure deps are removed correctly
  - Like react, react-dom, react-router, react-router-dom, redux, etc
- Setup serving on html for local dev
** For Libraries
- Setup story book
* Tech Tracking
- Reference custom react-scripts package
* Investigation
** Env
- general environment variables are through .env file
- .env.production
- environment variables must start with "REACT_APP"
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables?source=post_page---------------------------
** Build types (keep amount of commands shortened)
- Local Builds: npm run start
- QE BUILDS:
- Normal Master BUILDS:
- Beta BUILDS:
- Prod BUILDS:
** Setup Tracking
*** Look into passing library usage or something so things arent duped
*** Setup Error tracking
- Sentry, Rollbar, Airbrake, etc
*** Setup user tracking
- Mixpanel, - mixpanel library?
  - take in props for tracking, assuming user is already identified
** Cache Warming
** Uglifying
- [x] ascii only?
- [x] screw ie8?
** Investigate how to have css dynamically imported on imported builds
- Or maybe require people to manually import?
  - seems like incredible effort and build path knowledge
** Add different templates for
- [ ] embedded app
- [ ] servable app
- [ ] library
